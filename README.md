# Duy Nguyen's Portfolio

This is a work-in-progress portfolio, entailing some of the things I have been learning as a self-taught front-end developer and a reflection of some of the themes and aesthetics I personally like. My resume, LinkedIn, this Github profile and more will be linked here. There will be a contact form available to send me messages about various things from opportunities to simply a greeting. The current look is not going to be final and there are many details missing and it definitely is not very friendly for users to look at. I will be working on this more in-depth.

The style that I will be attempting to implement is something along the lines of Street Fighter 6. I have recently been getting into fighting games like Tekken and Street Fighter, and I really enjoy the aesthetic of the neon lights, grafitti and garage themes from Street Fighter 6, so I figured I could try to add some of that and it would be a nice reflection showing off my skills and personality.
